# 29. Write a Python script to concatenate following dictionaries to create a new
# one.
# Sample Dictionary :
# dic1={1:10, 2:20}
# dic2={3:30, 4:40}
# dic3={5:50,6:60}
# Expected Result : {1: 10, 2: 20, 3: 30, 4: 40, 5: 50, 6: 60}


dic1 = {1: 10, 2: 20}
dic2 = {3: 30, 4: 40}
dic3 = {5: 50, 6: 60}

dic1.update(dic2)
dic1.update(dic3)

print(f'The single concatenated value is : \n {dic1}')
